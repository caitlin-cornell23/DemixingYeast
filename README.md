### DemixingYeast
## Repository for code related to phase separation in yeast vacuoles

Yeast vacuoles demix at temperatures below their growth temperature. Vacuole membrane demixing is as the result of lipid liquid liquid phase separation [see this publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000634951731072X)

We aim to quantify the specific mixing temperature of yeast vacuoles grown at different temperatures. We hypothesize that the demixing temperature scales with the growth temperature.
